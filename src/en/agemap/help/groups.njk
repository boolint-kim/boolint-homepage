<h1>Group Management</h1>
<p>Use groups to organize people into categories like Family, Friends, Work, and more.</p>

<h2>Creating a Group</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open the group panel on the right side of the main screen.</li>
  <li>Tap <strong>New Group</strong> in the group management screen.</li>
  <li>Enter a group name and choose a color.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Adding People to Groups</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When adding or editing a person, select groups using checkboxes.</li>
  <li>A person can belong to multiple groups at the same time.</li>
  <li>You can also add or remove members from the group detail screen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Group Filtering</h2>
<p>Toggle group checkboxes in the right panel of the age map to show only the groups you want.</p>

<h2>Editing/Deleting Groups</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Edit</strong> — Change the group name or color in the group management screen.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete</strong> — Deleting a group only removes the group itself; people in the group are not deleted.</li>
  <li><strong>Reorder</strong> — You can change the sort order of the group list.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Group Colors</h2>
<p>Assign a unique color to each group. Person cards on the age map will be displayed with the color of their group.</p>

<h2>Preset Groups</h2>
<p>Use the preset browse feature to load pre-configured group templates. Quickly set up groups without creating them one by one.</p>
